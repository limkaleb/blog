Next we will look into **retained earnings**. Total equity of ACES is around Rp 5.9 T as of 2022. And inside of those equity, there is **only** 171 M + 440 M = Rp 611 M capital. So, it means (5.9 T - 611 M) Rp 5,3 T which is **90%** comes from profit that has been collected for a period of time. Dividend is excluded from those numbers. If we count dividend as well, the result will be much higher.
